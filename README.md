# V2X-UniPool

This repository provides the official implementation of **"V2X-UniPool: Unifying Multimodal Perception and Knowledge Reasoning for Autonomous Driving" (ICLR 2026, under review)**.

## Overview
V2X-UniPool is a framework that:
- Translates heterogeneous multimodal V2X sensor data into **language-based knowledge**  
- Organizes this knowledge in a **time-indexed knowledge pool**  
- Enables **RAG-based reasoning** for accurate, safe, and communication-efficient planning  

Experiments are conducted on the real-world **DAIR-V2X dataset**, demonstrating improved planning accuracy, enhanced safety, and over **80% reduction in communication cost**.
